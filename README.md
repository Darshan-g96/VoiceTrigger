Speech-to-Text Command Interface

This is a single-file React application that utilizes the Web Speech API via the react-speech-recognition library to convert live microphone input into text. It is configured to listen for specific voice commands ("Hey Jarvis," "I would like to order \*," "clear screen") and provides immediate feedback.

The entire application—including all React components, logic, and comprehensive styling—is contained within a single App.jsx file.


Run Steps

Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (Chrome and Edge are highly recommended).

Environment Setup

Required Permissions

When the application starts, your browser will prompt you to grant Microphone Access. You must allow this permission for the speech-to-text functionality to work. If you block the microphone, the application will display a corresponding error message.
